The Atlassian Connector for Eclipse is an Eclipse plugin that lets you 
work with the Atlassian products within your IDE. Now you don't 
have to switch between websites, email messages and news feeds to 
see what's happening to your project and your code. Instead, you 
can see the relevant <a href=http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>JIRA</a> issues 
and <a href=http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo>Bamboo</a> build 
information right there in your development environment. Viewing your 
code in <a href=http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye>FishEye</a> is just a click away.</p>
